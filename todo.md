# General Notes
## Evidence expectations

control
iteration
asset
asset_iteration

Each control should have a configured frequency: Monthly, Quarterly, Yearly. Create an occurance of each of these time intervals for 20 years into the future.

As assets are scoped into the control, we should expect that evidnece be filled for each of this occurances for each asset. 

I think we can force all controls to work this way, even the event-based monitors, such as "Code Reviews" where there is no expectation of generating evidence in premeditated intervals.
